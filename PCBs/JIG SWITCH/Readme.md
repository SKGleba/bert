# JIG MULTI SWITCH
PCB for JIG for PCH-100x, VTE-100x and PCH-200x PSVITA

This is an alternative design to the MULTI board which should be closer to what the Sony official JIG may have been like.
Unlike the MULTI board design, this design requires a switch to change between PCH-100X and PCH-200X JIG detect circuits.

* Currently supprorts PCH-1XXX/PDEL-100x, VTE-100x and PCH-2xxx PSVITA at both 3.3V and 5V
* 5V design requires the use of 0 ohms resistors or solder bridges (recommended)
Throughhole design only.
