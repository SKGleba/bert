if you want to build JIG using the Throughhole board you will need the following: 

Other board designs follow the same BOM but resistor footprint is changed to 0805

- PSV Craddle PCH-ZCL1

Can be found on eBay or Yahoo Auctions Japan

- Breakout board (until the PCB I designed is tested)

/////OPTIONAL///// (not required if you connect the FTDI 3.3V VCC to the 3.3V pad)

- 3.3V PICO PSU (alternatively, you can use a bench power supply)

(anything 12v 2A (or higher) with 5,5 * 2,5 mm barrel connector should work) 

- 3 x 1k Ohms resistors (on normal design) OR 2 x 1k Ohms resistors (on ALT design)

- 2 x 330 Ohms resistors (only for ALT design)

https://www.amazon.com/BOJACK-Values-Resistor-Resistors-Assortment/dp/B08FHPJ5G8

- 1 x 150 Ohms resistor (only for ALT design)

https://www.amazon.com/BOJACK-Values-Resistor-Resistors-Assortment/dp/B08FHPJ5G8

- 1 x 220 Ohms resistor (only for normal design)
