if you want to build JIG you will need the following: 

Other board designs follow the same BOM but resistor footprint is changed to 0805

- PSV Craddle PCH-ZCL1

Can be found on eBay or Yahoo Auctions Japan

- FTDI RS232 USB module (set to 3.3v, you may set to 5V ONLY if you use the 5V version of the board)
